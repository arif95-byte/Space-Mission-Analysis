# The Evolution of Space Missions
# Global Overview
Purposes: Give executives or viewers a high-level snapshot of all missions and their outcomes.

# Executive Summary
# 1. Mission Growth Over Time
- The dataset spans 1957 - 2022, covering the entire modern space age.
- Two major surges:
  1. 1960s-1980s: Driven by the US-USSR space race.
  2. 2000s-2020s: driven by private sector growth (SpaceX, CASC, Ariancespace).
  3. Modern launches are more commercialized and frequent, reflecting llower costs, and reusable rockets.

# 2. Market Share by Organization
- Top 5 operators (RVSN USSR, CASC, Arianespace, General Dynamics, VKS RF) account for ~60% of all missions.
- Indicated state-dominated launches historically, but with commercial entrants growing after 2000.

# 3. Mission Reliability
| Status            | Count | %     |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Success           | 4,162 | 89.8% |
| Failure           | 357   | 7.7%  |
| Partial Failure   | 107   | 2.3%  |
| Prelaunch Failure | 4     | 0.1%  |

- Reliability > 89% shows maturity of space tech
- Failures cluster in early decades (1950s - 1970s)

# 4. Launch Economics
| Status              | Avg. Launch Price (M USD) |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Retired Rockets     | 258.4                     |
| Active Rockets      | 68.6                      |
| Successful Missions | 131.2                     |
| Failed Missions     | 55.5                      |

- Older (retired) rockets were costlier and less efficient.
- Modern active rockets are most cost-effective and reusable.
- Higher cost correlates with success, suggesting better hardware or mission preparedness.

Missions Over Time
- Space missions span from 1957 - 2022
- Strong early growth in the 1960s-1980s (space race era);
- Noticeable acceleration again post-2000 due to private companies like SpaceX and CASC.

Average Launch Price By Rocket Status
| Rocket Status | Avg. Price (Million USD) |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Retired**   | 258.4                    |
| **Active**    | 68.6                     |

Retired rockets tend to higher historical costs - likely due to older technologies or less efficient designs.

# Recommendations
- Invest in modern, active rockets.
- Titl volume toward USA/Russia for capacity, grow share with China/India for cost & diversification.
- Smooth demand with multi-year planning.
